## Multiplayer — Prerequisite Issues

These issues form an architectural dependency chain. None should be attempted until single-player is feature-complete. Tackle in roughly the order listed.

- [ ] **#M1 — League as first-class entity**: `state.league` is player-owned but a league is a shared competitive environment — the player *participates in* one, not *owns* one. The correct model: `League` is a standalone entity with its own state and event log; players and NPCs hold a `leagueId` reference; multiple humans in the same division share one `League` instance. Requires splitting `buildState` into player-state + league-state. Do not attempt mid-season. This is the load-bearing issue — everything else below depends on it.

- [ ] **#M2 — Pre-season rebuild scoped to league, not player**: `handlePreSeasonStarted` currently rebuilds NPC slots from `state.division`, which is a single-player assumption. Once leagues are first-class entities, pre-season logic (resetting the table, reassigning NPC slots, handling promotion/relegation) belongs on the `League` aggregate, not inside any individual player's command handler.

- [ ] **#M3 — Per-league event log**: Currently a single `events[]` array in `GameState` serves both player decisions and league-level facts (results, standings). In multiplayer, league results are observed by all participants — they need to live in a shared, per-league log. Player decisions (upgrades, transfers, training) stay in each player's private log. Requires a clear boundary between what's personal state and what's shared state.

- [ ] **#M4 — NPC strength evolution scoped to league history**: `previousLeagueTable` currently lives on `GameState` (player-owned). NPC AI strength adjustments each season should derive from the league's own finish history, not a snapshot in one player's state. Depends on #M1 and #M2.

- [ ] **#M5 — Global player ID namespace**: Player IDs are currently scoped to a single club (`inherited-${clubId}-${index}`, `free-agent-${index}-${seed}`). In a shared world, player IDs must be globally unique across leagues and clubs. Requires a world-level ID registry or UUID scheme before any cross-player transfer market is possible.

- [ ] **#M6 — Server-side persistence**: localStorage is sufficient for single-player (one event log, one device). Multiplayer requires a shared state store — each league's event log must be readable by all participants. Decide: server-authoritative (simpler, no conflict resolution) vs. CRDT-style (complex, offline-first). Do not choose an approach without a concrete hosting plan.

- [ ] **#M7 — Async turn-based sync**: Once leagues and event logs are properly separated (#M1–#M3), the turn-based multiplayer mechanic itself — submitting a week's decisions, waiting for all participants, advancing the sim — can be designed. This is the last issue in the chain, not the first.

### Phase 7: Isometric Stadium — SC2K Visual Overhaul

Full rework of the stadium renderer to give it a SimCity 2000 "living machine" feel. Three-tone shading, per-facility micro-animations, and a match day overlay with moving player blips.

**SC2KTile component (3-tone shading)**
- [ ] Replace flat-colour tiles with proper 3-face geometry: top / left / right
- [ ] 2:1 tile ratio (tileW 64, tileH 32), unitH 12px per level — buildings grow vertically with upgrade level
- [ ] Three-tone rule: `topFace = color`, `leftFace = shadeColor(color, -15)`, `rightFace = shadeColor(color, -30)`
- [ ] Cast ground shadow (black, 15% opacity) offset at 135° to anchor buildings to the grid — prevents "floating" during animations
- [ ] `shadeColor()` utility — lighten/darken hex by percentage

**Construction state**
- [x] Construction lag — FACILITY_UPGRADE_STARTED / FACILITY_CONSTRUCTION_COMPLETED events; 2–6 week timers; amber dashes + 🏗 icon in isometric view ✅ (PR #66)
- [ ] `hazard-slide` CSS keyframe — animated yellow dashed stroke (`stroke-dashoffset` 0→12, 0.5s linear infinite) on tile base while `isBuilding` (static dashes currently in place)
- [ ] `construction-jostle` keyframe — 2px vertical translateY oscillation (2s ease-in-out infinite) on the building body
- [ ] Dust particles — emit small SVG `<circle>` elements at tile base while upgrading (CSS fade-out, seeded positions)

**Per-facility micro-animations (ambient, always-on when active)**
- [ ] Scout Network — small 2D radar dish on roof, CSS 360° rotation loop
- [ ] Medical Centre — Red Cross neon flicker (opacity 0.7↔1.0 oscillation)
- [ ] Fan Zone — SVG flag paths flutter via `skewX` animation
- [ ] (Remaining 7 facilities to be designed — one looping animation each)

**Match day overlay**
- [ ] `MatchDayOverlay` component renders on top of the Pitch unit during match sim
- [ ] 22 `<rect>` blips (2×2px): 11 home colour, 11 white (away)
- [ ] Default jitter: ±2px random movement every 500ms within positional zones (defence / midfield / attack)
- [ ] Surge state: attacking team blips shift mean x-position toward opponent goal when attack event fires
- [ ] Goal celebration: scoring team blips converge on centre circle for 3 seconds
- [ ] Blip movement must be deterministic (seeded by gameWeek + playerId) — not `Math.random()` — so replays are consistent
- [ ] `crowd-flash` keyframe on Stands tiles — staggered brightness spikes (2.5× and 3× peaks) per stand section; `animation-delay` varies by section to avoid global strobe

**Visual connectivity**
- [ ] Auto-path tiles between adjacent facilities — "concrete" texture rendered between neighbours
- [ ] All path tiles respect Painter's Algorithm (gc+gr sort order) — blips and dust must not appear behind foreground buildings

**Technical constraints**
- [ ] All animations CSS-based or `requestAnimationFrame` — no JS `setInterval` for visual updates (Chromebook perf)
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` media query disables all keyframe animations (accessibility — school use)
- [ ] Z-indexing: animated overlay elements always respect Painter's Algorithm sort order
- [ ] `isMatchDay` boolean on `gameState` is the trigger for crowd-flash and blip overlay; no animation outside match context

**Match director — advisory (verify against game wiring when Phase 7 begins)**

> ⚠️ The current match sim is deterministic and runs synchronously — there are no streaming `matchEvent` emissions mid-simulation. This spec assumes a real-time event feed that doesn't currently exist. Treat as design intent; implementation approach needs to be worked out against actual game architecture.

Blip state machine (5 states):
- `IDLE` — default jitter around home coordinate based on position role (Def / Mid / Atk)
- `BUILD_UP` — blips drift toward opposition half; speed tied to `teamwork` attribute
- `CHANCE` — high-intensity jitter near opponent goal area
- `CELEBRATE` — scoring team's blips converge on pitch centre / corner flag (3 seconds)
- `RESET` — blips glide back to starting isometric coordinates

`PitchDirector` component concept:
- Sits inside the Pitch core unit `<g>` on the 20×14 grid
- Receives `matchEvent` (goal scored / attack attempt) and drives phase transitions
- Player blips receive `phase`, `speed` (from `teamwork / 10`), `aggression` (from `attack`)
- Renders only while `isMatchDay` — single `<svg>` or `<g>`, not 22 individual React subtrees

Goal reaction cascade:
- Trigger `crowd-flash` simultaneously on all Stands units (the "Flash Mob")
- Fire existing Reputation flash animation on home goal — immediate positive reinforcement
- Scoreboard / Fan Zone tile briefly shifts to bright neon white ("Jumbotron effect")

Performance notes for Chromebooks:
- Use `transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out` on blips — GPU-handled, not JS-calculated per frame
- Blip engine renders only during match context (`isMatchDay`) — zero overhead outside match
- 22 blips as `<rect>` elements inside one `<g>` is cheap; avoid mounting as individual React components with their own state/intervals

## Balance / Tuning

- [ ] Balance pass — observe growth/decline rates, retirement frequency (~1–2/season), and whether promotion to L1 feels meaningfully harder; run passively during normal play-throughs rather than as a dedicated task

## Captured Thoughts

- Isometric SVG: right vertex of tile (c,r) = top vertex of tile (c+1,r) — this identity makes multi-tile footprint math clean and composable
- Painter's algorithm in SVG is just document order — sort by gc+gr ascending, render first = draws under
- React stale closure trap: mousemove handler captures state at render time; useRef is the correct escape hatch, not useCallback alone
- Domain dist freshness is a hidden worktree gotcha — new worktrees branch from main but inherit stale `dist/`; always `npm run build` in domain first
- The "NASA for Football" aesthetic is the north star for Command Centre — data-dense but legible
- Club events are the main creative differentiator — invest time in the writing
- Branching path dependency (past decisions unlock/block future events) creates replay value
- Star ratings for business acumen should feel rewarding, not punishing
- Integer pence arithmetic was the right call — no floating-point issues anywhere
- FACILITY_CONFIG is single source of truth — domain, reducers, and frontend all read from it
- Pitch and Stands are two visual core units backed by one STADIUM facility
- Two-tier grid principle: Core units = navigation anchors (clickable); Sub-units = visual/stat effects only (pointer-events: none)
- Grounds & Security directly impacts attendance rate — natural math hook for percentages
- Food & Beverage ties into existing "Hot Dog Hygiene" club events — narrative hooks built in
- Fan Zone + Grounds & Security were late additions that improve decision density and visual variety
- ~2.8 mandatory decisions/week is too thin — Weekly Training Focus (PR 5) is the quick win
